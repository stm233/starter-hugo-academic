As a PhD student specializing in computer vision, I am deeply passionate about advancing the field of image and video compression. My research focuses on developing innovative algorithms and techniques to enhance the efficiency and quality of visual data compression.

With hands-on experience in object detection and segmentation, 
I have honed my skills in creating robust computer vision models that 
can accurately interpret and analyze visual information. Recently, I have extended 
my expertise to practical applications by developing an [AI Deck detection app](https://deckdetect.com/), 
which leverages state-of-the-art computer vision technologies to provide effective and user-friendly solutions.

I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and am always eager to collaborate with professionals who share a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential opportunities, share insights, or explore collaborations.
